            <p>
                Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, 
                Patricia, who defied the racistlaws of apartheid 
                by having a child with a white Swiss immigrant, Robert. 
                Despite the danger and social stigma associated with their
                relationship, Robert never supported segregation and did 
                what he could to undermine apartheid.

                Noah often felt caught between racial groups, not light 
                enough to be fully acceptedinto white culture and not dark 
                enough to be fully accepted into black culture. Apartheid ended
                in 1994, but Noah continued to face struggles as a mixed-race child
                in South Africa.

                He had to navigate different social settings and determine which
                groups would accept him. Patricia encouraged her son to read and 
                think independently, instilling in him a love for education and multiple
                languages (Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans)

                 In "Born a Crime," Noah talks about the apartheid system in South Africa, which saw 
                 racial segregation enforced by the government. Similar inter-ethnic disputes and tensions 
                 have occurred in Marsabit County, resulting in discrimination and racial segregation among 
                 people of all races. The challenges encountered by people from diverse ethnic backgrounds 
                 in Marsabit County bear similarities to the racial differences portrayed in Noah's narrative.
