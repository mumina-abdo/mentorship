            <p>
                Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, who defied the racist laws of apartheid by having <br>
                a child with a white Swiss immigrant, Robert. Despite the danger and social stigma associated with their <br>
                relationship, Robert never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Noah often <br>
                felt caught between racial groups, not light enough to be fully accepted into white culture and not dark <br>
                enough to be fully accepted into black culture.
                <br>
                Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah continued to face struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa. <br>
                He had to navigate different social settings and determine which groups would accept him. Patricia <br>
                encouraged her son to read and think independently, instilling in him a love for education and multiple <br>
                languages (Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans). This skill allowed him to move among different racial and <br>
                cultural groups at school.
                  <br>
                 In "Born a Crime," Noah talks about the apartheid system in South Africa, which saw racial segregation enforced by the<br>
                  government. Similar inter-ethnic disputes and tensions have occurred in Marsabit County, resulting in discrimination <br>
                  and racial segregation among people of all races. The challenges encountered by people from diverse ethnic backgrounds <br>
                  in Marsabit County bear similarities to the racial differences portrayed in Noah's narrative.
