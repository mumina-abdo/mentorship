            <p>Born a Crime by Trevor Noah is an autobiographical book that recounts the comedian and television<br>
                 personality's experiences growing up as a mixed-race child in apartheid South Africa. The memoir<br>
                  provides insights into Noah's life, as well as the culture, systems, and history of South Africa <br>
                  during this period.
                  <br>
                Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, who defied the racist laws of apartheid by having <br>
                a child with a white Swiss immigrant, Robert. Despite the danger and social stigma associated with their <br>
                relationship, Robert never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Noah often <br>
                felt caught between racial groups, not light enough to be fully accepted into white culture and not dark <br>
                enough to be fully accepted into black culture.
                <br>
                Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah continued to face struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa. <br>
                He had to navigate different social settings and determine which groups would accept him. Patricia <br>
                encouraged her son to read and think independently, instilling in him a love for education and multiple <br>
                languages (Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans). This skill allowed him to move among different racial and <br>
                cultural groups at school.
                <br>
                Noah's experiences included dealing with law enforcement his mother received no help from the local police<br>
                 when she tried to file charges against her abusive husband and being arrested himself for various offences.<br>
                  Despite these challenges, Noah recognized his privilege compared to many of his peers who faced greater hardships.
                  <br>
                The relationships with the men in Noah's life taught him little about interacting with women. His father was a distant<br>
                 figure, while his stepfather Abel became violent towards Patricia after they married.
